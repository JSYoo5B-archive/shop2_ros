; This file illustrates some uses of ordered and unordered task lists.
; A couple of notes about this file:

; - The problems p1 and p2 are different ways of accomplishing the
;   same effect.  The former combines the operators and ordering
;   constraints in one big method.  The latter divides this
;   information across multiple methods.  Problem p3 also performs the
;   same operators but does so under a different starting state.

; - The ordering constraints require that !b1 always be invoked before
;   !b2, but do not impose any restrictions on where in the process !a1
;   and !a2 occur.

; - Operator !a1 asserts the fact foo on the given argument and
;   operators !a2 retracts that fact.  This fact is a precondition for
;   !b1.  This interaction restricts the range of possible orderings
;   for valid plans.

; - The find-plans commands below are invoked with the :which :all
;   argument to illustrate all possible orderings that can be produced
;   for these examples.  In practice, however, you will most often
;   want to use :which :first (the default) to just find a single plan
;   (since finding all possible plans is typically very expensive or
;   even infinitely expensive for most realistic domains).
